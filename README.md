## Trying Amazon Web Service using Cloud Academy Hands On Labs

Here I followed six AWS tutoriols given below on Cloud Academy.

**1. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE (LINUX)**

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. EC2 provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazonâ€™s computing environment.

Below is a screenshot of the Linux EC2 instance I created.

**2. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE (WINDOWS)**

In this tutorial, I created a Windows EC2 instance on AWS and connected to it using Remote Desktop connection as given below.

**3. MANAGING INSTANCE VOLUMES USING EBS**

During this, I learned to create an EC2 instance with an additional EBS volume and more. Here EBS means Amazon Elastic Block Store that provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.

But I failed to create a filesystem in the new EBS volume I created.

**4. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON S3 BUCKET**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web

Here I  went through the bucket creation process and its first usage according to the tutorial.

**5. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON S3 BUCKET**

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by instance store.

During this tutorial, I learned to setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.

**6. CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON RDS DATABASE**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. 

In this tutorial MySQL database engine was used and later mysql client was used to connect to the craeted RDS instance.

All of the above was recorded as a google hangout session. Link: https://youtu.be/a_hqnrg6ARI
